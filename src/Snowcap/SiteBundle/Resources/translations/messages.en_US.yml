    After ten years working in various medium and large web and communication agencies, learning a lot, facing added values and issues of different structures, we ended up with the conclusion
    that if we wanted to achieve our goal, which is developing high quality cutting-edge web applications - and enjoy doing it, we had to have a dedicated environment.

    In September 2010, Snowcap was born.

    The main ideas of Snowcap's concept is to offer, thanks to our combined skills, a straigth stream, from the analysis of the project to the best suitable technical infrastructure, and to offer our
    clients a direct and smooth communication with the producers, which delivers a more qualitative and innovative result by combining the vision and goals of both parties.

    In other words, since the best projects out there are made by real passionated and motivated crews, we created ourselves a way of being so.
