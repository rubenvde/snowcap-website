    Snowcap is a small web development agency located in Brussels. Using a finely balanced mix of open-source technologies, web standards and technical ingenuity, we deliver kick-ass online platforms that will help you communicate about what you do.

    * Here is what we have to offer:
    * Analysis and technological strategy
    * Website and web application development
    * Content management system implementations
    * Intranet and extranet development
    * E-commerce platforms installation and customization
    * Database management
    * Hosting
    * IT consultancy / support


    We use almost exclusively open-source software. While some IT domains can benefit from proprietary solutions, the web is an area where open-source shines. No license fee and no usage restriction.

    Note: pour les technologies, le texte ne doit pas forcément être affiché à tout le monde. Ca peut être du “tooltip” ou autre. Sous forme d’icônographie ce serait sympa. Il faudrait aussi que nous puissions en rajouter au fur et à mesure...

    __PHP__: Open, robust, and comes with a lot of great-quality libraries, we use it alone or with the Symfony MVC framework in order to provide flexible and performant solutions.

    __Python__: a modern an elegant language, ideal to manage tricky processes or connect heterogen systems

    __HTML, CSS and Javascript__: respecting web standards, we use it to deliver light and highly usable interfaces

    __Adobe AIR__: this platform, developed by Adobe, is a good choice for light online / offline applications.

    __Linux__: Still powering most of the good part of the internet, we rely on it for our projects infrastructuremethod:
