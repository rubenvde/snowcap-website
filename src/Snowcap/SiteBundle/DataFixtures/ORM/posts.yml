  body: |
    Snowcap launched his first project under the [Symfony framework](http://www.symfony.com "Symfony Framework"): Moving People(www.movingpeople.com "Moving People").
    It was a real pleasure for us to discover and work with this Framework, and surely will continue to do so!
    This corporate website, designed by [One Million Dollars](http://www.onemd.be "1MD"), runs with 5 languages and his content is completely managed by the client.
