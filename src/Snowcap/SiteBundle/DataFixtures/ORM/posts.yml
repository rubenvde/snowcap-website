  title: Getting some AIR
  slug: getting-some-air
  summary: |
    We just released a web & desktop application for a french hotel group. The purpose of this tool is to allow hotel staff to manage vouchers given to privileged
    customers. Since their internet connection can be unreliable at times we built them a desktop application that can be used in offline mode ; when the connection is back up, the tool performs a full data synchronization
    between hotels. As it is a purely internal application, you won't be able to see it in action, but we really wanted to share with you our first project made with the Adobe AIR technology.

    Mediargus and Pressbanking run a huge press database, that include all the major belgian newspapers and magazines. They asked us to build a proof-of-concept for their project.
    Its purpose was to aggregate the content of every daily belgian newspaper, in order to make it available to third parties through a webservice. This content can then be used on
    a wide variety of channels and devices. Based on the Zend framework, the delivered proof of concept was a sucess, both in terms of implementation time and in terms of results :
    it processes several gigabytes of data every night.

    summary:
        Snowcap was launched in september 2010. We've been very busy since then. Here is a short summary on what we have been doing.
    body: |
        A little more than one year ago, the three of us (Edwin, Jérôme and Pierre) left the agency we were working for and created our own company. It was a very exciting time, and there was much to do.

        In fact, we have been so busy that we took about 13 months to launch our own website. Now that it is online, it is time for us to publish a first status report.

        %% The first steps

        When we decided to create our own little agency, we had no name for it yet. We had to find one, and fast. After countless tries, and heated discussions, we finally agreed on Snowcap, for different reasons - the first one being that we liked the sound of it.

        Then, we needed a visual identity so we contacted our friends from 1MD. They came up with the symbol/mountain logo, which, apart from being beautiful, was a perfect fit for the image we wanted to promote :
        simple yet highly recognizable.

        Of course, at that point, trying to get contracts took the biggest part of our time. I remember us being afraid of sitting in a quiet room with nothing to do, waiting for the phone to ring.
        Fortunately for us, the phone did ring, and quite a few times. Our planning quickly filled up, week after week, and we never had the time to get bored, or even to give a lot of thought to our business model.

        %% 13 months of code, projects and releases

        Between september 2010 and today, we worked on 20 different projects. E-commerce, institutional or corporate websites, enterprise applications and even some pretty exotic stuff (check the cases section if you want to know
        the details). To be honest, a few months before, we didn't really think it would go this fast.

        %%% A sort of bet

        In hindsight, what we did was a sort of bet. We were deeply convinced that there was a market for a coders-only web agency, but the only way to know for sure was to build it.

        From that point of view, our first year was a success. There is a solid demand right now for small, highly specialized agencies with a high degree of flexibility. Customers proved to be more comfortable with the approach
        than expected, and we realized that small shops such as ours can be attractive not only to small and medium businesses, but also to bigger corporate players.

        %%% Development as a first-class citizen

        When we created Snowcap, one of our goal was to convince customers that the technical details of their website did matter. It means that the development team should be included early in the project loop, and be kept in it.
        Having developers around from the very beginning is the best way to ensure that your business plan will be translated into a fast, solid and secure website. Our clients and partners have proved to be quite receptive to that message.

        %%% New tools, new tricks

        Another one of the motivations behind Snowcap was to be in a position where we could quickly evaluate and adopt new tools or technologies. We are pretty satified on that topic too, as we definitely learned a lot of stuff this year. From
        performance optimizations to responsive / adaptative web design techniques, we are definitely on the right track.

        %% What's next ?

        2011 is nearly over, and we have already a lot of resolutions for 2012. First, we're going to keep on sharpening our technical skills. There are numerous tools and techniques that we want to explore in 2012. Then, we will try to do less cms-based
        projects, in favor of custom development (we will write another post on that specific subject shortly). And finally, we have decided to get more involved in the open-source community. We have been free software enthusiasts
        for several years, and we feel that now is a good time to start contributing.

        Before we get back to code and machines, we would like to thank our customers and our partners, for entrusting us with their projects. Thanks a lot to the guys from One Million Dollars, who, in addition to giving us
        a great logo, also designed this website. Many thanks as well to Xavier Portela, who took all those cool pictures of us in 80's skiing gear.

        See you next year !

  title: Why we chose Frameworks
  slug: why-we-chose-frameworks
  summary: |
    We've built many websites and web applications from scratch, upon CMS's & eCommerce platforms, and upon Frameworks.     
    We had CMS expert positions in big companies; we know them very well.     
    But now we took a decision.      

    __We'd like to work exclusively with Frameworks.__

    %% Context

    We've built many websites and web applications from scratch, upon CMS's & eCommerce platforms, and upon Frameworks.     
    We had CMS expert positions in big companies; we know them very well.     
    But now we took a decision.     

    *We'd like to work exclusively with Frameworks.*

    %% Definitions

    Let's start with the basis to explain our decision:

    %%% From scratch

    Applications made from scratch means that the devlopers starts with the core programming language, and build every single functionality home made

    %%% CMS / eCommerce platforms

    Drupal, Magento, and many others offers a __complete environment ready to use__: a frontend website, a backend administration module, and often a huge set of working functionalities, like a blog, calendars, image galleries, ...

    %%% Frameworks

    Definition from Wikipedia:

    > _"In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by user code, thus providing application specific software. It is a collection of software libraries providing a defined application programming interface (API)."_

    Frameworks are __between the two other approaches__: it's a complete environment for the designers & developers to work with (sending emails, search functionalities, database accesses, ...) but without any frontend or backend built-in nor any business logic: it's leaves it to the developer.

    %% Benefits and drawbacks

    Now let's see the benefits and the drawbacks of each approach:

    %%% From scratch

    The developers are __truly the owner__ of their application: they made it themselves from the beginning!    
    But this also means that they have to reinvent the wheel over and over again, since many operations (ie database access) has to be done for each project.    
    It's __time consuming__, and significantly improves chances to leave __bugs__ here and there.    
    Also, if they need backup on the project, they have to explain their whole way of thinking to new developers.

    %%% CMS / eCommerce platforms

    With those developers can have a fully __functional website in minutes__! Wow.    
    And there's a __great community__ behind, with many modules & functionalities, ready to support.

    But then, they have to match the client's requests and expectations and merge them into the existing business logic of the application. Here's were they start to struggle: they have to __tweak the application__ to fit the requirements. And sometimes they can't (budget speaking), and they have to convince their client that what they suggest (what the CMS suggests) is better than what he wants.

    And for the backend part, ther's a bunch of options/links/buttons/functionalities/shortcuts/lists, where the client will most probably use 10% of it. It often scares him and he finally ask the developers to do it themselves "to be sure it'll be done the right way".

    Finally, since it offers many functionalities, it has to take care of all of them, even if you don't use those. I'm not going too into details here but this implies huge performances issues (overcomplicated database data model, many unneeded objects in memory, ...)

    %%% Frameworks

    Lying in between, a Framework allows the developer to build the frontend and the backend interface exactly the way the client wants, and this with the advantage of not reinventing the wheel - the Framework contains many libraries to assist him.
    In other words, the developer focuses his development only on the client's business logic.

    And like CMS's, it also provides community support, since the core is open-source and maintained by the community.

    %% False ideas

    We often hear the following remarks, and wanted to share them with you:

    **CMS's are more affordable: most of my needs are already in it**     
    For the first phase of the development, that's true. But when it comes to fill the last 10-20% gap between how the client wants his website and the CMS business logic, you quickly catch up and exceed the time needed with Frameworks to reach the final functionality.

    **CMS's are secure, maintained, and heavily supported**     
    Maintained and supported, yes. Secure, hum, yes and no. They're secure in the fact that many people is digging into it and could find a security risk, but it's not the case for the external modules the developer will download (and he will download some to meet the requirements).    
    Another point is that if a security breach is found, it's publicly noticed, so the developer has to update his version quickly to avoid exposing himself.

    In the meantime, Frameworks are equally maintained and supported, and most of them have made security audits. Those audits are much more easy to do on Frameworks (libraries of functionalities) than on CMS's (visual code and business logic).

    **I want a CMS because many other companies do, so it sounds good**     
    Let's see why they chose it first, see if they're happy with it, and leads us to our little conclusion:

    *If you reached Snowcap to ask for a development, we hope that you don't want the same as your competitor, but that you want something innovative, powerful, and reflecting your business.*
